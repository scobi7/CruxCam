# CruxCam
Pose Estimation and Analysis for Climbing

# done
How are videos labeled? 

Name-Description.MOV
OM = one move (one move-r)
FR = Full Route

# done
First step is to use OpenCV and MediaPipe in order to get lines on the climbers and limbs for SNN Torch Analysis. 
OpenCV creates ground truth labels and the coordinates of the poses.

# in progress
Get labels from OpenCV

# to do
Then SNN/DL can be used to learn the labels generated by OpenCV.
I.e., given input video, or event camera data, try to figure out the pose + return the coordinates of limbs etc.

# challenges
The videos are oddly inaccurate frame by frame. My code is having a hard time being accurate with body labeling.

HOWEVER, I used a digital camera (old) and I think maybe the lighting with that camera is better(?) because the frames 
were way more consistent. Still trying to figure out how to print those numbers.
